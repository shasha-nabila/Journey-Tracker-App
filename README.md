# PuppyPilot: A Journey Tracker App
This repository was cloned from my university account, which was a group project developed with five other people. We created an application named PuppyPilot, designed to allow users to view and manage their travel journeys on a map. Users can register, upload GPS data, view their journeys, and access journey statistics. Admins can estimate revenue and review data related to registered customers.
